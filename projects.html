These projects were selected for a number of reasons. I want to portray the wide range of languages and types of projects, and also show some of the work I am most proud of. Some of these projects are from school, but some are from my own free time. If you are interested to find out more about a specific project read the description on this page or the readme on github. If you have a question about a specific project don’t hesitate to contact me through the “contact” section on the home screen. The projects are in no perticular order.</p></div>

                <p class = 'disc'>I made this website within days of learning css and html. It was my first step into front end development. Some challenges I faced when doing this project was figuring out how to move around and fit everything onto the screen in a way that's easy to navigate and visually pleasing. I enjoyed working in something that I was not well versed in (prior to this I only knew python and some C++). Learning how to make a webpage was a more artistic approach to software development that I had not yet experienced. A cool fact about this webpage is that the colours are the exact colours that discord uses. I find their UI to be calming and tidy.</p>
